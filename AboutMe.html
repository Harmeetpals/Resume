          <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
          <h4>Guru Gobind Singh Ji </h4>
          <p>
            The leadership of <strong>Guru Gobind Singh Ji</strong> is a true inspiration. His humility, empathy, and visionary guidance continue to shape my personal and professional values.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Albert Einstein: </strong>As a child, Albert Einstein struggled with traditional education methods
          , often seen as slow by his teachers. His unconventional way of thinking and reluctant to follow rote memorization
        made him appear disingaaged. However, his curiosity and deep analytical mind allowed him to explore concepts beyond his years. 
      Rather than accepting limitations imposed by a system, he nurtured his own learning through indipendent thinking, 
    ultimatly leading a ground breaking discovery in physics. His story serves as reminder that true inteligence is not meassured 
    by conventional standards but by ones ability to think differently.</p>

    <p>One of Einstein’s greatest contributions was his theory of relativity, which introduced the concept that time is not absolute but relative. This idea is now a fundamental part of many scientific and technological advancements, including its impact on BIM. In BIM, the 4D dimension integrates time into 3D models, allowing for project scheduling, sequencing, and simulation of construction phases. The very concept of 4D BIM—where we visualize changes over time—aligns with Einstein’s vision of time as a flexible dimension rather than a fixed entity. His work reminds me that even in a technical field like BIM, innovation stems from bold, foundational ideas that change how we perceive and manage complex projects.</p>

          <h3>Favorite Quotes</h3>
          <p><strong>Occam's Razor:</strong> If multiple theories explain a phenomenon equally well, the simplest one (i.e., the one with the fewest variables or complexities) is likely to be correct.</p>
          <p>"Do not focus on just one tree; embrace the vastness of the forest, the strength of the mountains, the flow of the rivers, and the wisdom of every tree that stands beside it."</p>
          <p><strong>Albert Einstein: </strong>"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."</p>
          <p><strong>Albert Einstein: </strong>"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."</p>
