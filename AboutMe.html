          <h3>My Inspirations</h3>
          <h4>Guru Gobind Singh Ji </h4>
          <p>Guruji was a visionary leader, who instelled strength and resiliance in his followers. In 1699, they founded the khalsa panth and transformed ordinary people into saint-soilders
            who would stand for truth and justice. Their leadership was based on service and equality. They lead by example, teaching his followers to remain fearless in the face of oprression. 
            His ability to unite people and inspire them to rise against tyranny makes him one of history’s greatest leaders.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Despite his immense wisdom and strength, Guru Gobind Singh Ji remained humble and saw himself as a servant of God rather than a ruler. He never sought personal power or wealth but instead dedicated his life to the well-being of his people. Even after forming the Khalsa, he humbly took Amrit (baptism) from the Panj Pyare (Five Beloved Ones), showing that no one, not even the Guru, is above the principles he established. His humility teaches us that true leadership is about service, not superiority.          </p>
          <br>
          Guru Gobind Singh Ji was not only a warrior and leader but also a profound poet. His works, written in Braj, Persian, and Punjabi, are filled with wisdom, valor, and devotion. His compositions, such as Jaap Sahib, Chandi Di Var, and Zafarnama, inspire spiritual awakening and resilience. His poetry embodies the warrior spirit while promoting divine love and universal brotherhood. Zafarnama, his letter to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, is a masterpiece that conveys how truth ultimately triumphs over falsehood, even in the face of oppression.

            <h4>Alberty Einstein</h4>
          <p>As a child, Albert Einstein struggled with traditional education methods
          , often seen as slow by his teachers. His unconventional way of thinking and reluctant to follow rote memorization
        made him appear disingaaged. However, his curiosity and deep analytical mind allowed him to explore concepts beyond his years. 
      Rather than accepting limitations imposed by a system, he nurtured his own learning through indipendent thinking, 
    ultimatly leading a ground breaking discovery in physics. His story serves as reminder that true inteligence is not meassured 
    by conventional standards but by ones ability to think differently.</p>
<br>One of Einstein’s greatest contributions was his theory of relativity, which introduced the concept that time is not absolute but relative. This idea is now a fundamental part of many scientific and technological advancements, including its impact on BIM. In BIM, the 4D dimension integrates time into 3D models, allowing for project scheduling, sequencing, and simulation of construction phases. The very concept of 4D BIM—where we visualize changes over time—aligns with Einstein’s vision of time as a flexible dimension rather than a fixed entity. His work reminds me that even in a technical field like BIM, innovation stems from bold, foundational ideas that change how we perceive and manage complex projects.</p>

          <strong>Occam's Razor:</strong> If multiple theories explain a phenomenon equally well, the simplest one (i.e., the one with the fewest variables or complexities) is likely to be correct.</br>
          <br><strong>Quote: </strong>"Do not focus on just one tree; embrace the vastness of the forest, the strength of the mountains, the flow of the rivers, and the wisdom of every tree that stands beside it." </br>
          <br><strong>Albert Einstein: </strong>"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."</br>
          <br><strong>Albert Einstein: </strong>"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."</p>
